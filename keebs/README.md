# Mechanical Keyboards

My foray into the mechanical keyboard hobby started in 2001, when my kid asked for a GMMK TKL for Christmas. Since then, I've learned a lot about keyboard modification and building. In this section, I'll share some of my knowledge and preferences, and show off some of my collection.

## Keycaps

Keycaps were my gateway into the hobby, as it it allowed me to take my keyboard (and, by extension, my office) from boring and drab to cute, or witchy, or silly, or stupid. With any mechanical keyboard, keycaps are by far the easist thing to customize. First, I explored keycaps by color and theme, then learned to choose by material and profile, which are significant factors in changing the sound and feel of the keyboard.

### Cherry MX compatible

The term "Cherry" is a bit confusing because it can refer to either stem compatibility or keycap profile or the actual keyboard company. When a description notes that keycaps are "Cherry MX compatible," it is referring to the MX switch stem -- the little cross that the keycap attaches to. It is the most widely used switch stem for mechanical keyboards, Other stem types include Alps or Topre, but if you're just starting out in mechanical keyboard customization, you probably will not be using them (or you will, I don't know your life).

### Dye-sub vs. Double-shot
This is the process by which the keycaps get their colors or. Dye-sublimation is when the legends, colors, and/or theme are printed on the keycaps using a heat process, while double-shot is an injection-molding process ([more info here](https://switchandclick.com/double-shot-vs-dye-sub-keycaps-whats-the-difference/)). Doubleshit keycaps have historically been sharper and of higher quality, and they can come backlit for RGB keyboards. However, dye-sub designs have come a long way and, in my opinion, come in much cuter themes (see [Osume](http://osumekeys.com) and [Goblintechkeys](http://goblintechkeys.com)).

### Keycap profiles
I won't get into what each profile looks like here, as [Switch and Click already has a great comparison](https://switchandclick.com/ultimate-guide-to-picking-a-keycap-set-for-your-mechanical-keyboard/). I'll just go into my own experience and preferences. 

  **Cherry** profile keycaps are the most common and also my favorite. I've found that they feel the most natural and also sound the best, even for the lower-quality ones. They're slightly more difficult to match for 75%, 96%, or any other non-traditional layouts, but that usually just means three or four keys off to the side might be at wonky heights.

  **DSA** profile is popular among the super cute designs by [Mintlodica](http://mintlodica.com) and [Astrolokeys](https://drop.com/buy/drop-dsa-astrolokeys-keycaps-by-sailorhg-and-cassidoo?defaultSelectionIds=966965). I love those sets, but I find the keycap profile is lighter weight and tends to sound a little more clacky and high-pitched. Not my favorite. However, because all rows are uniform, they are way easier to match profile for any keyboard layout.

  **SA** profile are sculpted and tall, with R1 (the function row) being ridiculously tall. I include it here because some of my favorite color ways have come out on this profile (Espresso, Vilebloom, Black Panther), and I believe they're considered pretty premium, but I like them only slightly more than DSA keys.

  **Lofree Touch** is admittedly a weird inclusion here but I have exactly one kit from them (Graffiti), and it's one of my favorites. Lofree is the only company I've seen with this particular profile -- it's sculpted and very similar to the SA profile, but the bottom row curves back up. So both the function row and spacebar row are completely ridiculous heights, but the designs are great and the weight of the keycaps also feels premium.

  **XDA** keycaps seem to be the current fan favorite, but personally I hate them. The rows are uniform like DSAs, but all of the sets I've seen look cheaply made.

## Keyboard layouts

This was my next step in keyboard evolution. For a long time I was just using the standard-issue Magic Keyboard layout, not knowing I could opt for number row or choose how much space it took up on my desk. Here are my findings.

* **40%, 60%, and HHKB**: They take up the least amount of space and are apparently great for developers, but I need dedicated arrows and I can never remember layers.
* **65%**: Lacks a function row, but has dedicated arrows and is therefore doable. Still, I like having an F-row.
* **75%**: My second favorite layout, as it includes arrows and an F-row, and sometimes even a knob or tiny screen. It's also efficient with the desk real estate.
* **80%/TKL**: Not really my bag, as I don't use Home/End or Page Up/Down, and that area of the keyboard takes up too much space.
* **96%**: My favorite layout, as it's a 75% with a squished number row. It's also becoming more popular to customize, so there are many more options for this now than in 2021.
* **Full size**: The other extreme. It takes up way too much space and is also ugly.
* **Alice/Ergo**: I know these come in different sizes and therefore layouts, but the split is generally not for me.

## Switches

When you get to this part of the keeb journey, you've fallen fully down the rabbit hole and there is no turning back. This is where you start getting *really* into the intricacies of sound and feel, and people start to look at you crazy.

There are hundreds of ways to change the sound and feel of your typing experience through switches alone, depending on switch type, spring weight, component materials, lubing, or filming. There are loads of resources online about switches that I will link at the end of this topic, but in this section I'll offer some of my own notes and experiences.

### Type: Linear vs. Tactile vs. Clicky vs. Silent linear vs. Silent tactile

Linear switches have a smooth up-down feel, while tactiles have a noticeable bump (though how pronounced that bump is will depend on the switch), while clickies have a noticeable bump and audible click. Linears tend to be my favorite (especially [Gateron Oil King](https://www.amazon.com/Gateron-Switch-Linear-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B09T5B98N2) and [Gateron Unicorn](https://hippokeys.com/products/gateron-unicorn-linear-switch)), but have found a few tactiles (usually in nylon or POM housing) that I really love, like the [Holy Pandas](https://drop.com/buy/drop-holy-panda-x-mechanical-switches?searchId=884c9c5748c83eb102d8889ff0bc3af4&defaultSelectionIds=967407) and [Gateron Cap Golden Brown](https://keebsforall.com/products/gateron-cap-v2-switches?variant=42453414215899&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&srsltid=AfmBOopomWvK_f8y2wkIxvNkznAw4zkmHle_to7z_FIYm4G7d1_QeAzf5kk).

If you work in an office and want to be courteous to your fellow coworkers, avoid clickies at all cost, which are usually marked as blue. They're not terrible, they're just loud and annoying for anyone not doing the typing. I personally don't mind using [Kailh Box White](https://www.amazon.com/Kailh-White-Mechanical-Keyboard-Switches/dp/B07885QL77/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=kailh+box+white&qid=1695932531&sr=8-3) every once in a while, but I work from my own home office.

Silent linears and silent tactiles are similar to their non-silent counterparts, but have a component inside the switch that ensures it produces no noise. In my experience, all silent switches have felt mushy on the bottom-out. So I've mostly hated silent linears, but have found silent tactiles to be more tolerable, as they feel a little closer to Topre/rubber dome switches, such as the [Haimu Whisper](https://cannonkeys.com/products/haimu-whisper-silent-tactile-switch).

### Spring weight

Admittedly I know the least about this part of the switch, as I know the switch material might have a slight impact on feel and performance. I usually go by weight. The lower the number, the lighter the switch. The higher the number, the more force with which you need to press the keys. I prefer switches in the 50-65g range which, compared to the larger spectrum of spring weights, is somewhere in the middle but leaning more toward light.

### Lubing and filming

Lubing will usually improve the sound and feel of switches (they will glide more easily and sound less scratchy), while filming switches will help reduce stem wobble. These are mods that require additional materials (stem lube, spring lube, and/or switch films), and popping open each switch. You can do any combination of these but it is generally very time consuming and rough on the fingers and eyes. I have only ever once filmed a set of switches and didn't notice mmuch of a difference. I have lubed several sets using [BadSeedTech's fast lubing method](https://youtu.be/jYiH6P53miM?si=wtKzgnZVPtWi0wbs), which has worked a charm. But these days, I generally buy switches that are factory pre-lubed. Factory pre-lubing is not always consistent, but I'd rather save the time.

## Other considerations and modifications

* There are a few cheap mods you can do to further dampen the sound of a cheap keyboard. **Tape modding** is the easiest, cheapest, and can have the biggest impact. Basically, you put layers of masking tape on the back of the PCB, although if your keyboard has a battery then you might want to use electrical tape. Another cheap mod is lining the inside of the keyboard case with **foam**.
  
* Another "mod" that seems pretty obvious but should be stated are **desk mats**. To paraphrase a particular dude, they really ties a desk together, but they can also absorb sound really well.
  
* I really wish people would stop using the term "creamy." This refers to keyboards that have more of a marbly, muted sound, so I prefer to use the less icky term, "**marbly**." If you want a marbly sound, you should go for a heavy aluminum keyboard that comes with silicone dampening or poron foam. I've gotten this sound from my Zoom65, Zoom75, and QK75.
  
* I have nothing against **GMMK Pro** or **Keychron** as entry ways into aluminum and more premium keyboards. GMMK Pros are fun because you can get different colored top frames and knobs, and sounds decent as a kit. Keychron has the most variety in terms of layouts, but I would highly suggest getting a different plate (like an FR4 plate) for it, as the steel ones that come with the kits produce a high-pitched ping.
