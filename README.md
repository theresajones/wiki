# Knowledge Base

This repository contains information on the things I know about technology, technical writing, the Apple ecosystem, mechanical keyboards, ereaders, remote work setups, and whatever else I feel like sharing. I hope you find some of this information helpful!

## Background
I'm a writer in the tech industry. I write and design technical documentation, online help, API reference, UX text, and other sundry. I've also been in the mechanical keyboard hobby and building keyboards since 2021. 

I'm based in California with my partner, two kids, two dogs, and two cats.
