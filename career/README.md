# Technical Writing

I've had a long enough career at this point to be able to identify some patterns and have some wisdom to impart. If you're interested in technical writing as a career, here are my best pieces of advice. You'll find some helpful keywords to search for in **bold**.

## What is technical writing?

Generally, technical writers create some kind of documentation for a company in the form of user manuals, technical documentation, knowledge bases, copy, or internal communications. However, what technical writers are expected/asked to do varies widely from company to company, based on industry, size of team, organizational structure, product, and age of the company/what stage of growth they're in.

## Why technical writing?

It sounds boring to a lot of people, but it's a great career for those of us who are both technical and creative, who can understand code or the mechanics of how things work, but might not necessarily want to be hands-on with those functions. In some companies, it has all the great parts of engineering without all the stress and high stakes. Also, it's one of few roles that has been remote for decades, so it's slightly less difficult to find a remote position.

Also, surprisingly, I've met far less creative writers in this line of work than I would've expected. I went into editorial fresh out of college and have freelanced for magazines throughout my life, and the pay is unstable and mostly terrible. Technical writing was an amazing career for me to fall into. It's a stable path with a high income, and it still affords you some time and energy to work on your own creative projects at the end of the day!

## What are the downsides of technical writing?

Because of my personality and preferences, I find almost no downsides to this career in general, but other people might find some of these things difficult. 

For one, it tends to be solitary work. Even if you are working with a team of technical writers, often you are assigned to specific projects as the sole writer. This means you'll have to stay on top of your work on your own, gather research on your own, and manage documentation projects on your own. And if you work from home, you really have to be a self-starter and have some modicum of discipline.

Additionally, technical writer responsibilites are never really cut and dry. Even if individual project managers or engineers have worked with technical writers before, you will always have to develop and enforce a new process whenever you're put on a new team or project. And you will have to frequently bug people for reviews and sign-offs. Even though it's solitary work, it does require soft skills because you'll have to meet with and verbally communicate with your team pretty regularly. 

## What skills are required?

Because no two projects are ever the same, technical writers need to have a grab bag of skills outside of just being able to write and communicate effectively.

1. **Soft skills** are pretty much the most important, and I've found it trumps technical knowledge in interviews all the time. Documentation relies on the knowledge of others, and you will need to talk to a lot of different people to get that information. This process is a lot smoother when you're easy to talk to and people like you.
2. **Project management** skills are also a great thing to bring up in interviews, as your deliverables are dependent on developers and you will need to manage deadlines on your own. Certain industries also require extensive reviews and sign-offs, so there are often lots of moving pieces we deal with as writers.
3. While **technical knowledge** is important, it's highly variable and dependent on the industry and products you're writing for. Obviously you want to practice interviewing and reference technical skills from the specific job description, but just remember that knowing methodologies and frameworks is more important than specific tools. You will pick up tool knowledge on the job.

## What kind of formal education or prerequisites do I need?

Most companies hiring technical writers will require a college degree of some sort or "equivalent work experience." However, you do not need a degree specifically in technical writing. My BA is in English, though communications is often close enough, and some industries will have a preference for degrees in STEM majors. A BA/BS might not even necessarily be required -- an AA/AS might be sufficient in some cases.

If, however, you have a degree in something entirely unrelated (nursing, art, psychology, economics, etc.), lots of accredited schools offer technical writing certifications that can help bridge that gap.

In addition to this -- or if you don't have the money or time to pursue a certification -- the next best thing you can do is create a portfolio of writing samples. This can be a website or a folder stored locally on your computer that you email or attach to your applications. If you have no previous projects or experience to pull samples from, then pick literally any topic to write a manual about. Some ideas that I am 100% dead serious about, regardless of industry:

* How to change your car's oil
* How to make a sandwich (NOT a recipe, but a procedural)
* How to set up your home's wifi
* How to create a website
* How to bathe a dog
  
Anything you have knowledge about can work, as long as you are able to write instructions that an interviewer can understand.

## What technical knowledge do I need to have?

Again, this is highly variable depending on industry but I want to note that technical writers are hired and needed in *many* different industries and not just in software or hardware technology. Outside of tech, I often see a lot of technical writer openings in health care, automotive, aerospace, energy, and medical devices. Those jobs will have a preference for domain-specific knowledge, so it could be a good transition for you if you're already working in those industries and just want to try something new.

### Entry level
If you're entry level and looking for your first technical writing job in any industry, you should look to build your knowledge on the fundamentals.

1. First, work on grammar rules and **plain language**.
2. Work on a basic understanding of the **software development lifecycle** and different **SDLC methodologies** to understand how teams work and where your work fits in.
3. Gain a basic understanding of **structured authoring, information architecture, usability, user research, and documentation minimalism**.
4. Any type of technical or domain-specific knowledge can edge out other candidates. I landed my first technical writing job because I had an English degree and knew HTML from designing my Myspace page.  
 
This will give you a well-rounded foundation in understanding your audience and knowing how to write documentation that is helpful and usable. If you don't yet have work experience, talking up your ability to get along with others and know the right questions to ask can gain you some ground.

### Leveling up or looking in tech
Tool and technology expertise becomes more important when leveling up in your technical writing career, or looking for roles specifically in technology. Note that companies hiring writers at the senior level are usually past basic documentation written in Microsoft Office.

1. Understand **HTML and CSS** basics. Every tool will require some knowledge on styling, and HTML will give you the best foundation.
2. Read up on **DITA, XML, and Madcap Flare**. DITA is the standard for **structured authoring**, and XML is the language used for it. There are several kinds of editors that can work with XML, but the one I've used the most is Madcap Flare. It's super expensive and not very practical to have your own personal license for, but if you are unfamiliar with the interface then try your best to just watch tutorials around the web. Otherwise, learn the fundamentals of XML.
3. Know how to use **Git**. I've used a ton of different version control systems throughout my career, but Git was the most technical and the hardest for me to learn. When you understand Git commands, you not only have a solid foundation of **docs-as-code** (which is becoming more popular), but the other version control systems become much easier to pick up.

### Nice-to-haves

What I've listed so far are general recommendations when you're trying to get your foot in the door. When you've gotten to the second or third technical writing position of your career, you're well established and have more options based on your experience and how you want to grow. The following skills can help you get there, or might take you in a more specialized direction.

1. **Graphic design**. In my career, I've used Adobe InDesign, Figma, and other design apps to support the documentation I was writing. While InDesign and Photoshop skills are needed for labeling and print documentation, experience in Figma can get you in the door with UX roles.
2. **Programming and API documentation**. This is one of those more specialized branches of technical writing, and you're probably already pretty seasoned if you at this point. The thing is, if you know how to code, you're likely already working as a developer and moving from the other way. In which case, I'd recommend working on your soft skills (I kid, I kid).
3. **Accessibility knowledge**. It's important to be familiar with accessibility guidelines, full stop. However, if you're *super* knowledgeable about accessibility and usability, you can help guide larger initiatives if you're looking to do some good in the world and also get some project management experience.
4. **Localization expertise**. When companies need documentation translation, they will hire  translators with expert knowledge in a specific language, so it's not usually expected of technical writers to be bilingual. However, there *are* ways to write and prepare documentation that is easier to globalize and localize. Knowing those best practices can be attractive to companies that are trying to expand their reach.
5. **Framemaker**. Framemaker is an old tech writing holy grail app, but is really only used in shops that produce print documentation. You *might* be asked about this depending on the industry, but in my opinion it seems to be on its way out.
6. **Training**. This is more adjacent to **instructional design**, which is its own field and an entirely separate role, but pedagogy or creating training can easily be spun into technical writing experience if your moving into this field from teaching.  

## My guiding principles

Throughout my career, I've stuck to the following philosophies to guide my writing:

* Whenever I start a new project, I remind myself how much I hate actually having to read the manual and write accordingly.
* Therefore, I write for an annoyed audience. It doesn't matter who the user is or how technically inclined they are -- by the time they reach the documentation, they are at least *mildly* inconvenienced and annoyed. They need documentation that is easy to read and navigate.
* I can't stress this enough -- presenting yourself as someone who's easy to work with and eager to help will get you pretty far. Documentation is important, and there will be times where you have to push back or be a nag to get information that you need, but we work in supportive content and there's rarely a situation that warrants having to be a diva.
* Remember that we're all just advanced monkeys on a spinning rock in space. Your coworkers, your customers, and the people you buy your lunch from are all just human beings who deserve kindness. Take your work seriously but remember it's never *that serious*.
