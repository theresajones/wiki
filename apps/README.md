# Apps (Mac and iOS)

I have a very clear preference for apps that:

1. Integrate and sync with Apple and/or Google services, or at least allow you to store your data locally, rather than requiring sign-up to another service.
2. Charge a one-time fee (even if it's a separate purchase per platform and major upgrade), rather than a monthly subscription.
3. Also have an iOS and/or iPadOS app.
4. Allow you to download your data and easily import into other apps.
5. Are not resource-heavy.

That said, I often have to use apps like Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office, and Madcap Flare for work. Industry standards, obviously, and they are best in their class, but that doesn't mean I enjoy using them.

Anyway, below is a list of all the *other* apps I find worthy of sharing, with some notes attached.

For my favorite app extensions, [go here](extensions.md).
