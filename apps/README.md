# Apps (Mac and iOS)

I have a very clear preference for apps that:

1. Integrate and sync with Apple and/or Google services, or at least allow you to store your data locally, rather than requiring sign-up to another service.
2. Charge a one-time fee (even if it's a separate purchase per platform and major upgrade), rather than a monthly subscription.
3. Also have an iOS and/or iPadOS app.
4. Allow you to download your data and easily import into other apps.
5. Are not resource-heavy.

That said, I often have to use apps like Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office, and Madcap Flare for work. Industry standards, obviously, and they are best in their class, but that doesn't mean I enjoy using them.

Anyway, below is a list of all the *other* apps I find worthy of sharing, with some notes attached.

For my favorite app extensions, [go here](extensions.md).

## Utilities

* [Alfred](http://alfred.app): An extendable Spotlight replacement. My most used app.

* [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12): THE keep-awake utility.
* [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/): A Swiss army knife type of app that does shortcuts, automations, screenshots, touchpad and mouse actions, and touch bar customization really well.
* [Brave](http://brave.com): I'm back to using Safari as default, but Brave has completely replaced Chrome as backup.
* [Dropover](https://dropoverapp.com/): A great drag and drop tool.
* [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/): Automated file processing.

* [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/): An indispensible shortcut and automation app.
* [Lunar](https://lunar.fyi/): An app to control monitor brightness.
* [Mission Control Plus](https://www.fadel.io/missioncontrolplus): A small app that makes Mission Control easier to use.
* [PastePal](https://onmyway133.com/pastepal/): My favorite clipboard manager. Syncs across all of your Apple devices.
* [PopClip](https://www.popclip.app/): An extremely lightweight, extendable tool that pops up whenever you select text.
* [Power Menu](https://fiplab.com/apps/power-menu-for-mac): A handy Finder extension that provides customizable actions without getting in the way.
* [Shifty](https://shifty.natethompson.io/en/): An easy-to-customize Night Shift controller.

## Productivity

* [Bitwarden](http://bitwarden.com): An open-source secrets manager that integrates well with lots of other apps, no subscription needed.
* [BusyCal](https://www.busymac.com/busycal/): The calendar app I've stuck with. It includes Reminders integration, has great widgets, and best of all, is a one-time purchase for each platform.
* [Dato](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dato/id1470584107?mt=12): One-time purchase utility that puts your calendar and preferred time zones in the menu bar.
* [DEVONthink Pro 3](http://devontechnologies.com): A document keeper and web clipper that makes all of your local content more searchable.
* [Focus](https://heyfocus.com/): A simple distraction blocker that works across all browsers and apps.
* [HazeOver](https://hazeover.com/): An easy-to-customize window dimmer.
* [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/): A lightweight screenshot annotator app that is also OCR-capable.

## Writing and note-taking

* [DayOne](http://dayoneapp.com): The journaling app I keep going back to, even with the subscription model.
* [Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/): The app I settled on for use with Apple Pencil.
* [Hookmark](https://hookproductivity.com/): Contextual link creator. Super helpful for research linking and notetaking.
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): An "everything writing" app. It's suitable for all sorts of notetaking and writing because it supports tons of extensions.
* [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview): The reigning champ for drafting and organizing longform writing.
* [SideNotes](https://www.apptorium.com/sidenotes): A note-taking app that sits on the side of your screen, perfect for taking notes during Zoom meetings.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): My primary app for docs-as-code content writing.

## Miscellaneous

* [BookTracker](https://booktrack.app/): A local (non-Goodreads) reading tracker that has nice widgets.
* [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/): The eBook library I've been using for years. I keep the file system on Dropbox so I can download from any of my devices, while Calibre manages the metadata and conversion.
* [Downie 4](https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/): A handy media downloader.
* [Friendly Streaming Browser](https://apps.apple.com/na/app/friendly-streaming-browser/id553245401?mt=12): A separate browser for streaming services that blocks ads.
* [Mela](https://mela.recipes/): A recipe manager for Mac and iOS. I used and loved [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) for years (the devs have always been very responsive, and it works on Windows and Android), but the Mela UI is just more polished and has all the same features.
* [Parcel](https://parcelapp.net/): The best package tracker on Mac. It has useful widgets and the most amount of carriers I've seen.
* [Parallels MAS edition](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/parallels-desktop/id1085114709?mt=12): A virtual machine app I really only use for Windows-only keyboard firmware. The Mac App Store version seems to work faster and installs less bloatware than the original version.
* [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/): The only Bittorrent client I've ever used.

## Retired

I have a few beloved apps that I've gotten rid of due to changes in my workflow or in the interest of simplicity. They're still useful and I can vouch for them; they just no longer served their purpose for me.

* [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/): A keyboard customizer for keyboards not available on QMK/VIA. I abandoned it in favor of native macOS keyboard customization.
* [Only Switch](https://github.com/jacklandrin/OnlySwitch): A menu bar app for all the things that *should* be in Control Center but are not. I stopped using this when Apple improved the widgets with Sonoma, but it might be useful if you're on an older OS.
* [QSpacePro](https://qspace.awehunt.com/en-us/index.html): A decent Finder replacement that can also be used as an FTP client.
* [Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy): A software KVM solution. It's fallen out of favor since Apple introduced Universal Control, but I used it whenever Universal Control seemed unstable.
