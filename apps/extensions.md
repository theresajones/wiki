# Extensions

A list of my favorite extensions, workflows, plugins, and macros, sorted by app.

## Alfred

* [System Settings](https://alfred.app/workflows/alfredapp/system-settings/): Open specific system settings panes.

## Obsidian

Quick note: I am a former user of Notion and I *loved* it, for the most part. However, I didn't like that I couldn't download my data last I checked, so I've moved onto Obsidian, which is very different. Some of my favorite plugins turn Obsidian into Notion, which some power users might not be into.

* [Advanced Mobile Toolbar](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-advanced-toolbar): Just a plugin to make the iOS apps easier to use.
* [DB Folder](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder): Brings database functionality to Obsidian to make it behave a little more like Notion.
* [MAKE.md](https://www.make.md/): Brings a lot more Notion-like functionality to Obsidian.
* [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git): Brings Git functionality to Obsidian.
* [Smart Connections](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections): A great AI-powered plugin that can search your notes and help you make links between your ideas.

## Popclip

All Popclip extensions are [located here](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/). Popclip is generally useful for sending highlighted text to any of your preferred apps for note-taking, search, translation, productivity, code editors, and even media players. I've just listed my favorites below that are not app-specific.

* Calculate: Highlight any math expression and Popclip will display the answer.
* Convert: Highlight a conversion (like "6 gallons to liters") and Popclip will display the answer.
* Terminal: Run selected text as a terminal command.
* Word Count: Popclip will count the number of words you've highlighted.

Additionally, [Brett's Popclip Extensions](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bretts-popclip-extensions) are great if you do a lot of work in Markdown.
