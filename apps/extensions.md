A list of my favorite extensions, workflows, plugins, and macros, sorted by app.

## Keyboard Maestro

The KM macros I se the most are ones I created myself and they're specific to my setup. Still, I want to share some of my favorite hotkeys:

* Move windows around to various displays, or various halves of displays (upper, lower, left, or right)
* Refresh pivot tables in Numbers
* Move current tab of a Chromium or Safari browser to a different display
* Toggle system dark and light mode

## Obsidian

Quick note: I am a former user of Notion and I mostly loved it. However, I didn't like that I couldn't download my data last I checked, and navigation to notes was cumbersome, so I've moved onto Obsidian, which is very different. Some of my favorite plugins turn Obsidian into something like Notion, which some power users might not be into.

* [Advanced Mobile Toolbar](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-advanced-toolbar): Just a plugin to make the iOS apps easier to use.
* [DB Folder](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder): Brings database functionality to Obsidian to make it behave a little more like Notion.
* [MAKE.md](https://www.make.md/): Brings a lot more Notion-like functionality to Obsidian.
* [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git): Brings Git functionality to Obsidian for automated vault backup.
* [Smart Connections](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections): A great AI-powered plugin that can search your notes and help you make links between your ideas.

## Popclip

Popclip is generally useful for sending highlighted text to any of your preferred apps for note-taking, search, translation, productivity, code editors, and even media players. I've just listed my favorites below that are not app-specific.

* [Calculate](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/x/1E6Xw): Highlight any math expression and Popclip will display the answer.
* [ChatGPT](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/x/1g1Pz): Send text to ChatGPT and it'll write back the response.
* [Convert](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/x/152fJ): Highlight a conversion (like "6 gallons to liters") and Popclip will display the answer.
* [Terminal](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/x/13U7m): Run selected text as a terminal command.
* [Word Count](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/x/17H9S/): Popclip will count the number of words you've highlighted.

Additionally, [Brett's Popclip Extensions](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bretts-popclip-extensions) are great if you do a lot of work in Markdown.
